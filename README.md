#How It Works
The application listens for incoming tweets on the @BeverageFinder Twitter handle. If the tweet has
not been tweeted by @BeverageFinder and it is not simple a retweet, it will analyze the text of the
tweet and extract a drink (cocktail) name. It will then search the API for a match and tweet back
with the recipe, method and a picture of how the cocktail should look.
